# hprof-rs

This is a Rust library to read `.hprof` files.
This is the file format used for JVM heap dumps.

The library is developed in parallel with https://github.com/SirYwell/heap-dump-browser, a browser-based
tool to analyze heap dumps using WebAssembly.
As a consequence, this library might encounter frequent changes to meet the requirements.

Contributions are welcome!
